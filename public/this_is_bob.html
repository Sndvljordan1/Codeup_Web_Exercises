- Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
- Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
- He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him. THAT MEANS ALL CAPS!
- He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.
- He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
